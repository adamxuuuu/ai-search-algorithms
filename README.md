## AI Search Algorithms

This little project demonstrate the simple usage of classic algorithms
such as UCS and Gentic Algorithm


## Usage
Please install matplotlib and networkx

Open terminal in the src directory

### UCS
type in terminal 

`python ucs`

### Genetic Algorithm
type in terminal:

`python genetic_algorithm 0 100` (crack first password 100 times)

`python genetic_algorithm 1 20` (crack second password 20 times)

`python genetic_algorithm` (crack first password 1 time)
